## 4. Functionality

### 4.1 SEO & URLs
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Use Angular Universal to pre-render pages on the server. This ensures that
  search engine bots receive fully-formed HTML, allowing for immediate and reliable content indexing.
- **Static URLs**: Static, human-readable URLs for articles (format `/node/{id}`, e.g., `/node/15378`)
  and categories (`/category/{id}`).
- **Hydration**: After the initial server-rendered page is delivered, the client-side Angular application
  takes over, providing a seamless, interactive user experience without a full page reload.
- **Structured Data**: Implement JSON-LD (`NewsArticle` schema) to provide rich metadata to search engines,
  enhancing search result appearance (rich snippets).
- **Meta Tags**: Dynamically generate `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and OpenGraph tags for each page to
  ensure optimal sharing on social media and correct indexing.

### 4.2 Responsive Design
- Mobile-first layout.
- Adaptive typography and fluid images.

### 4.3 Accessibility
