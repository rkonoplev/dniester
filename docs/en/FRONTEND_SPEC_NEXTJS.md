## 4. Functionality
### 4.1 SEO & URLs
- **Hybrid Rendering Strategy**: Utilize Next.js's rendering capabilities to maximize performance and SEO.
  - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: For dynamic pages like the homepage and category listings, ensuring
    content is always fresh and immediately indexable.
  - **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: For individual article pages and static pages (`About`, `Contact`),
    providing the fastest possible load times.
  - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Optionally use ISR to rebuild static pages in the background
    at a set interval, combining the speed of static with the freshness of dynamic content.
- **Static URLs**: Static, human-readable URLs for articles (format `/node/{id}`, e.g., `/node/15378`)
  and categories (`/category/{id}`).
- **Structured Data**: Implement JSON-LD (`NewsArticle` schema) to provide rich metadata to search engines,
  enhancing search result appearance (rich snippets).
- **Meta Tags**: Dynamically generate `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and OpenGraph tags for each page to
  ensure optimal sharing on social media and correct indexing.
