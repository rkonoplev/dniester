> **Phoebe CMS** is a flexible, open-source headless content management system engineered for
> high-performance content delivery and modern development workflows.

**Phoebe CMS** is a modern, API-first content management system designed for developers and content
creators who need flexibility and performance.

## 🎯 Why Headless?

Headless architecture is the modern standard for professional organizations that need:

- **Design Control**: Complete freedom over frontend design and user experience.
- **Multi-Platform Publishing**: Deliver content to websites, mobile apps, and any other digital
  platform.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Easily connect analytics, marketing, and other tools.
- **Scalability**: An API-first approach built for future growth.
- **Flexibility**: Avoid being locked into a single frontend solution.

## 🏗️ Hybrid Architecture

Phoebe follows a **Hybrid Headless** approach:

```
phoebe/
├── backend/          ← Spring Boot API (headless core)
├── frontends/        ← Optional reference frontend implementations
│   ├── angular/
│   └── nextjs/
└── docs/             ← Documentation: "use our implementations or build your own"
```

**Benefits:**
- **Professional Teams**: Use only the API for maximum flexibility.
- **Startups & Small Teams**: Deploy everything "out of the box" using a provided reference implementation.
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: You're not tied to our reference frontends, but we provide them as fully functional starting points.
