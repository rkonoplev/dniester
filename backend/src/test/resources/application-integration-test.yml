# Spring Boot configuration for integration tests that use Testcontainers and Flyway.

spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      # Let Flyway manage the schema. Hibernate should only validate it.

    show-sql: false # Set to true for debugging SQL queries

  # Defer datasource initialization until after Testcontainers has started
  sql:
    init:

  # Flyway will run automatically, using the locations defined in the main application.yml
  # or profile-specific files. No specific Flyway config is needed here.

  # Disable H2 console for integration tests
