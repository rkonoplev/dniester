# Workflow for Java CI with Gradle and Qodana Cloud
# This workflow runs on every push to 'main' branch and every pull request to 'main'

# Define the job 'ci'

    # Define the sequence of steps for the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # 'fetch-depth: 0' is needed for Qodana to analyze the full git history
      - name: Checkout repository

      # Step 4: Make the Gradle wrapper executable

        run: chmod +x backend/gradlew

      # Step 5: Build the project and run tests with JaCoCo coverage

      # '--warning-mode all' helps identify deprecated features early
      - name: Build and Run Tests with Coverage
        run: cd backend && ./gradlew build jacocoTestReport --no-daemon --warning-mode all

      # Step 6: Upload JUnit test reports as artifacts
      # This allows viewing test results even if the build fails later
      - name: Upload test reports

      # Step 8: Run Qodana analysis for the Backend (JVM) code

      # Note on Baseline Files:
      # Qodana Cloud manages baseline files internally.
      # The 'baseline.xml' files are not generated locally or uploaded as GitHub artifacts.
      # To manage baselines:
      # 1. View and configure baselines in the Qodana Cloud UI.
      # 2. Download baseline files manually from Qodana Cloud if needed locally.
      # 3. Commit baseline files to the repository only if required for local Qodana runs.
